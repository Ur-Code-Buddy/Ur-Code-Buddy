Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Baivab, and I'm a student with a passion for Arduino, electronics, and Python. Welcome to my GitHub profile!


**About Me**

I'm currently a student at Sri Aurobindo Internation Center of education, where I am studying Maths Computer and Electronics. My technical interests include Robitics and Programming, and I love exploring new technologies and learning new things.

When I'm not working on projects, you can find me on Instagram. I also like working with microcontrollers, and I'm always looking for new ways to expand my horizons.
My Skills

Here are some of the skills I have developed over the years:

Arduino: I have experience with Arudino Uno, Esps and Raspberry-pi and have made projects like
  Quad Copters and Self balancing Robots.
Electronics: I have a strong understanding of basic Electronics, 
  and I have worked on projects such as Gate Making.
Python: I am confident in Python Programming, 
  and I have used Python to develop projects such as Todo apps and a few websites.

My Projects

Here are some of the projects I have worked on:

- Arduino Project: Smart Home Control System - A project that uses Arduino to control the lights, temperature, and security system in a home using a mobile app or voice commands.
- Electronics Project: Wireless Sensor Network for Environmental Monitoring - A project that uses sensors to measure temperature, humidity, and air quality, and transmits the data wirelessly to a central hub for monitoring and analysis.
- Python Project: Web Scraping and Data Visualization for Movie Reviews - I created a project that uses Python to scrape movie review data from websites like Rotten Tomatoes or IMDb. Using popular Python data visualization libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn, I was able to transform the raw data into informative and interactive visualizations. This project allowed me to showcase my skills in Python, web scraping, data analysis, and data visualization, and provided me with valuable insights into movie ratings and reviews.

You can find more of my projects on this account, most of my code is available on GitHub, if it's private, please send me a message and I will send it.
Get in Touch

I'm always interested in connecting with other developers and learning from their experiences. If you'd like to get in touch, you can find me on https://www.instagram.com/baivab_/ or email me at 05baivab@gmail.com.

Thanks for stopping by!
